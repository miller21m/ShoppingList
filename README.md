# shoppinglist

> A Vue.js project

This project was created as part of my Vue.js studies and to practice the following topics:<br />
 - Working with components.<br />
 - Communicating between Components.<br />
 - working With props.<br />
 - Handling user input.<br />
 
 This app functions as a Shopping list where the user can add/delete items from his shopping list.<br />
